      "Space Test Program 2 is a rideshare managed by the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), launching from LC-39A, KSC. Most of the spacecraft will be delivered into low Earth orbit (LEO) in two deployment sequences separated by a second stage burn. These LEO payloads include the six Taiwan and United States owned COSMIC-2 microsatellites, the Planetary Society's LightSail-B demonstrator cubesat, and others. The third and final deployment will be the Air Force Research Lab's DSX spacecraft, which will be delivered to a medium Earth orbit (MEO). This mission will reuse the side cores from Arabsat 6A, which will return to LZ-1, and LZ-2.

The booster and upper stage are expected to break up following capsule separation and there will be no landing attempt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

      "NASA's Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) will demonstrate the use of a kinetic impactor to alter an asteroid's trajectory, an intervention that could be used in the future to prevent devastating Earth impacts. The target system consists of Didymos, 780 meters in diameter, and its moonlet Dimorphos, 160 meters. The DART spacecraft will intercept the double asteroid, using autonomous guidance to crash into the smaller one. Moving at about 6 km/s, the transferred momentum should alter Dimorphos's 12 hour orbital period around its companion by several minutes. The mission tests several technologies, including the Small-body Maneuvering Autonomous Real-Time Navigation (SMART Nav) used to differentiate and steer toward the target body and Roll-Out Solar Arrays (ROSA) with Transformational Solar Array concentrators. NASAâ€™s Evolutionary Xenon Thruster â€” Commercial (NEXTâ€“C) ion engine will also be demonstrated, although the spacecraft's primary propulsion is hydrazine thrusters. DART should arrive at Didymos in late September 2022, when it is about 11 million kilometers from Earth. Ten days before impact, the Italian Space Agency's cubesat LICIACube will be deployed to observe the collision and ejecta with its two cameras. Earth-based telescopes will be used to measure the altered orbit.     1\n",

The booster was expected to land at LZ-1, however, due to the ongoing investigation and clean-up following the Crew Dragon testing incident, it is likely to land on OCISLY instead.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

      "Following second stage separation, SpaceX performed a test flight which attempted to return the first stage of the Falcon 9 through the atmosphere and land it on an approximately 90-by-50-meter (300 ft x 160 ft) floating platform-called the autonomous spaceport drone ship. Many of the test objectives were achieved, including precision control of the rocket's descent to land on the platform at a specific point in the Atlantic ocean, and a large amount of test data was obtained from the first use of grid fin control surfaces used for more precise reentry positioning. The grid fin control system ran out of hydraulic fluid a minute before landing and the landing itself resulted in a crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

      "Commercial mission and first Falcon 9 v1.1 flight, with improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity. Following second-stage separation from the first stage, an attempt was made to perform an ocean touchdown test of the discarded booster vehicle. The test provided good test data on the experiment-its primary objective-but as the booster neared the ocean, aerodynamic forces caused an uncontrollable roll. The center engine, depleted of fuel by centrifugal force, shut down resulting in the impact and destruction of the vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",

It is the first NASA high priority science mission launched by SpaceX. It was the first time SpaceX launched a scientific satellite not primarily intended for Earth observations. The second stage placed it into a high-Earth elliptical orbit, after which the satellite's own booster will perform complex maneuvers including a lunar flyby, and over the course of two months, reach a stable, 2:1 resonant orbit with the Moon.
